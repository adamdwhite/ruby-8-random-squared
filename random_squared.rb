# Instructions


# Using the Random class, generate a list of 20 random numbers between 0 and 49.
random_num = 20.times.map{rand 50}

# With the resulting array, build a new array that contains each number squared. For example, if the original list is [2, 5], the final list will be [4, 25].
random_num.each{|counter| print counter*counter, " "}
